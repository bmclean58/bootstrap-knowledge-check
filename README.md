In this assigment, I created a webpage using Bootstrap.
The webpage includes a registrtation form, a data table,
two images, two buttons, and a navbar. 

The registration form includes fields for first name,
last name, email, password, and a checkbox agreeing to
terms. The first and last name fields are side by side 
using Bootstrap's grid layout. There is a submit button.

The table features striped and hoverable rows. Data is
included to simulate registration form submissions. 
Table is responsive to screen size using table-responsive.

The first image of my puppied is made responsive with the 
img-fluid class. The second image of Justin Jefferson is made 
circular using rounded-circle.

The first button is visible on all screen sizes, while
the second is hidden on small screens.

The navbar includes likes to Home, About, and Contact
sections. On smaller screens, navbar collapses into
hamburger menu.
